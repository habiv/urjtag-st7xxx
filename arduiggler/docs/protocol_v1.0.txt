=== RS232 (UART) ===

Arduino has a [http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232R.htm FT232RL USB-to-UART bridge] which allows it to show as a UART port on all PCs with USB ports.
RS232 communication with Arduino defaults to 115200 bps, 8N1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and no flow control.



=== Protocol Description ===

The protocol consists of one byte of multiplexed data + command:

|| bit7 || bit6 || bit5 || bit4 || bit3 || bit2 || bit1 || bit0 ||
|| TDO  || cmd1 || cmd0 || TRST || TDI  || TCK  || TMS  || RSTb ||

==== Commands ====

 CMD_RESET (0b00)::
  This will reset all signals to the default values (0). The response to this command is RPLY_RESET (0x42).
 CMD_SEND (0b01)::
  This will set the signals to the values specified in the received byte. The response to this command is RPLY_SEND (0x4B).
 CMD_READ (0b10)::
  The response to this command is the value of TDO as either 0x80 or 0x00.
 CMD_RSVD (0b11)::
  Defined in the original code but never used.

The response to any other invalid command is RPLY_INVALID (0x7F).



=== Signal Use ===

 * TRST (digital pin 6), TCK (digital pin 4), TMS (digital pin 3), TDI (digital pin 5): outputs
 * TDO (digital pin 7): input
 * RSTb (digital pin 2): output, active low. Not really sure what it is intended to reset.
